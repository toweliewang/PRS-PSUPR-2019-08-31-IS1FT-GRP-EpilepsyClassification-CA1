## Epilepsy Classification

## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Believing that Epileptic Seizure Recognition is an area where we can apply Pattern Recognition to detect epileptic seizure accurately in order to provide timely treatment and improve the lives of these patients, the team sets out to search for a suitable dataset and apply data processing & Machine Learning techniques to detect Epilepsy and subsequently multi-class classification. A suitable dataset that can be accessed practically is the Epileptic Seizure Recognition data set studied by Andrzejak et al and provided to the UCI Machine Learning Repository by Wu et el. The team's findings and conclusion are presented in the project report.
